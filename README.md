# ELEC.02.01.Distance-Sensor-with-Bluetooth
This is a programmed circuit design for the chatbot robot. The robotâ€™s arms have three coordinated movements to welcome a person when he approaches a certain distance. In addition a signal will be sent to open the iPad screen through Bluetooth. 

Components:
2 Arduino Uno R3, 2 Breadboard, 6 Servo Motors, Wires and Ultrasonic.
-- the bluetooth isn't illustrated in this design so instead, I used the second Arduino to illustrate the connection.
